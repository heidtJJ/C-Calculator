CS445/545 Compiler Construction Homework 1

Write a basic integer calculator supporting standard arithmetic with 
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The calculator should
accept inputs from the command line and produces an output on the command
line (assume a UNIX/Linux environment, such as polaris1.clarkson.edu). 
Your calculator should build an intermediate tree representation for the
input and produces the output by evaluating the tree.
